1
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:04,785
Red...

2
00:00:06,396 --> 00:00:08,087
Just like the colour of her hair.

3
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:11,910
Red.

4
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:15,791
Her hair is redder than blonde red hair,

5
00:00:16,322 --> 00:00:18,743
the same color as my hands.

6
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:24,121
Long red hair... yes, that's it.

7
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:28,990
Give me your life.

8
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:32,299
Episode 1 - I, Got a Girlfriend!

9
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:35,736
I want to squeeze your boobs.

10
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,561
I agree with you Hyoudou Issei-kun!

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,418
Stop it. You're making me upset.

12
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:44,672
Matsuda, Motohama,

13
00:00:44,697 --> 00:00:47,918
why do we enroll in this school?

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,672
The private school, Kuou Academy, changes from an all-girls school to a co-ed school.

15
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:57,966
So, there are more girls than guys here,

16
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,307
and also many beautiful girls from abroad!

17
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:03,807
That's what makes us guys valuable.

18
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:06,847
In other words, we will become popular without having to try.

19
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:08,815
You can't mess it up!

20
00:01:09,577 --> 00:01:13,069
In short, we'll have a harem!

21
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,283
Yes, a successful life filled with boobs awaits us!

22
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:20,529
Spirit! Spirit!

23
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:22,116
...is what we expect

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,585
It's spring now, our sophomore year, and we still don't have girlfriends.

25
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:30,537
Stop it. You're making me upset.

26
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:32,116
We must not give up!

27
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,728
We still have a chance!

28
00:01:36,878 --> 00:01:38,299
Kiba!

29
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:39,807
What will you do next?

30
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:42,545
Hey, wanna go karaoke with us?

31
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,593
Sorry, but I have club activities right now.

32
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,720
What a shame, huh!

33
00:01:46,744 --> 00:01:49,894
Thank you for inviting me. I apologize.

34
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,315
Kiba Yuuto, class 2-C.

35
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:57,021
He's the idol of all the girls in school...

36
00:01:57,046 --> 00:01:59,228
...and an enemy to us boys!

37
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,982
Damn it!

38
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:05,355
He is liked by girls simply because he is handsome, quite smart, and kind!

39
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:07,950
Stop it. You're making me upset.

40
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:09,609
This world is really unfair, huh?

41
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:11,870
Oh, it's almost time!

42
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:13,315
Where are you going?

43
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:20,156
Murayama's boobs are really big, you know!

44
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,172
The size is 82-70-81.

45
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:24,712
Katase's legs are smooth!

46
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:26,926
The size is 78.5-65-79.

47
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:29,172
During gym class I accidentally found this place!

48
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,013
Hey!

49
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:35,680
Let me take a peek too!

50
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:38,688
Don't enjoy it alone!

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,680
Damn you!

52
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:40,688
Is there anyone outside!

53
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:42,061
You...!

54
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:48,101
What is it?

55
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:51,148
Hey, Matsuda, Motoha...ma...

56
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:54,402
You again?

57
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:56,029
Seriously.

58
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:57,997
W-Wait.

59
00:02:58,337 --> 00:03:00,037
Hyoudou pervert!

60
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:05,243
They really hit me with their bamboo swords.

61
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:07,331
You're so unlucky, Issei.

62
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:08,751
You guys left me!

63
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:11,751
I wouldn't complain if I at least saw some boobs,

64
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,751
but I didn't see it and they-

65
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:31,259
So, there really are people in this old building, huh?

66
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:34,990
Red hair is so beautiful, isn't it?

67
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:36,775
Rias Gremory.

68
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:39,482
The size is 99-58-90...

69
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:41,942
...and she was a member of the Occult Research Club for 3 years.

70
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:44,482
She said her family came from Northern Europe.

71
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:51,878
The guy from earlier...

72
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,204
Excuse me?

73
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:54,878
I mean the guy in the middle.

74
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,997
He's in class 2-B.

75
00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:01,077
If I'm not mistaken, his name is Hyoudou.

76
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:02,791
What's up with him?

77
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:06,712
Nothing. Maybe I just saw it wrong.

78
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:16,220
It's not a difficult problem.

79
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,521
Even though I've increased the difficulty a bit.

80
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:26,521
So?

81
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:29,037
I hope the next one is harder.

82
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:12,140
My school life was gloomy.

83
00:05:12,164 --> 00:05:19,188
Would my time at school be wasted without the chance to touch boobs?

84
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,021
A-Anu...

85
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:25,609
You are Hyoudou Issei-kun from Kuou Academy,

86
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:26,855
right?

87
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:30,355
Yes?

88
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:33,950
I've never seen that uniform before.

89
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:35,156
I wonder which school she is from.

90
00:05:35,512 --> 00:05:37,497
She is beautiful!

91
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:38,831
Well...

92
00:05:39,877 --> 00:05:41,870
W-What do you need with me?

93
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:43,172
Well...

94
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:49,172
Hyoudou-kun, are you dating someone?

95
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:51,378
N-No.

96
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:52,918
I'm grateful!

97
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:53,593
Huh?

98
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:58,553
W-Well, do you want to go out with me?

99
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,101
What did you just say?

100
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:08,148
I always see you passing by here and...

101
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,521
I know you are...

102
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:13,902
H-Hey, is this...?

103
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:16,283
I ask...

104
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:21,950
Please be my boyfriend!

105
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:30,458
A-Are you serious?!

106
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:33,251
Wake up, wake up!

107
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:38,712
I-If you don't wake up, I-I'll kiss you, you know!

108
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:41,466
Wake up, wake up!

109
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:42,585
Wake up-

110
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:48,561
Wh-What?!

111
00:06:48,585 --> 00:06:48,847
Why?!

112
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,386
This is Amano Yuuma-chan.

113
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:56,101
They are my friends, Matsuda and Motohama.

114
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:57,982
Nice to meet you guys.

115
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:00,228
And she...

116
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:02,728
...my girlfriend.

117
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:05,736
You guys hurry up and find a girlfriend too!

118
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:07,450
Come on, Yuuma-chan.

119
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:08,402
Okay!

120
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,156
Y-You traitor!

121
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:17,696
Date?

122
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,251
Yes, this Sunday. Can't?

123
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:25,085
N-No, of course I can!

124
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:26,751
I'm grateful!

125
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:27,545
See you!

126
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,005
Okay! See you.

127
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,878
I can't wait for our date!

128
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,470
Yes, so do I.

129
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,680
Date, date!

130
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:45,640
Sounds great!

131
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,442
Excellent!

132
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,450
So.

133
00:07:58,196 --> 00:08:00,355
It turns out that your interest is true...

134
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:02,378
Exactly right.

135
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:05,490
Choosing you to watch over him was the right choice.

136
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:08,870
Chairman, what should I do?

137
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,172
I will make some preparations,

138
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:15,458
But, it all depends on him.

139
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:23,640
She is a little late.

140
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,013
Please take a look!

141
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,886
I didn't mean to take one.

142
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:34,886
"We grant your request"?

143
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,442
It's like a trick.

144
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:38,767
Issei!

145
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,855
Good morning, Yuuma-chan!

146
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:42,362
Sorry, have you been waiting long?

147
00:08:42,386 --> 00:08:44,981
No, I just came.

148
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:48,910
I've always wanted to say that!

149
00:09:23,073 --> 00:09:24,188
What is it?

150
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:30,482
Are you okay?

151
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,355
Today is such a fun day, huh!

152
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,656
Yes, what a great day!

153
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:41,910
T-This is my big chance.

154
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:48,164
I did it!

155
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,759
Hey, Issei.

156
00:09:56,783 --> 00:10:03,085
Would you do something for me to commemorate our first date?

157
00:10:03,109 --> 00:10:07,339
Co-Could she be asking...

158
00:10:07,728 --> 00:10:10,601
W-What do you want?

159
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:14,601
Can you die?

160
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,521
What?

161
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:17,561
That...

162
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:18,561
Eh?

163
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:21,363
Sorry, Yuuma-chan. Can you say it again?

164
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,902
It seems like my ears heard wrong.

165
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:27,910
Can you die?

166
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,831
I saw it!

167
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,616
I see it clearly!

168
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:37,497
Even though it was short, I saw real boobs!

169
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:39,910
Finally I saw real boobs for the first time!

170
00:10:39,934 --> 00:10:41,831
And she's a beautiful girl too!

171
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:45,331
Is this what you call a show?

172
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:46,585
Not that.

173
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,839
Now is not the time for that.

174
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:50,847
Wing?

175
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:58,894
Even if it's for a while, playing puppy love with you is fun too.

176
00:10:58,918 --> 00:11:02,220
I will keep this gift from you.

177
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,426
So...

178
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:09,648
Yuuma-chan?

179
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:10,902
...please die.

180
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:22,037
Sorry, your life is a threat to us.

181
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:24,990
So we have to kill you as soon as possible.

182
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:29,958
Blame God for implanting the Sacred Gear in your body.

183
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:32,958
W... what?

184
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:38,926
Thank you for the pleasant memories.

185
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:42,878
Seriously.

186
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:50,101
I'm going to die in this small park because of the strange thing that just happened?

187
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:56,109
If you want to kill me, at least let me squeeze your boobs.

188
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:03,109
Even though I can only see a glimpse, your boobs are really big, Yuuma-chan.

189
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:10,410
Red.

190
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:14,529
Red, like her hair.

191
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:15,410
Red.

192
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:19,497
Her hair is redder than blonde red hair,

193
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:23,037
the same color as my hands.

194
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,132
What did I say?

195
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:29,958
I almost died.

196
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:33,839
It's over. Damn it.

197
00:12:33,863 --> 00:12:35,966
I can't move my body.

198
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:40,720
Damn. I don't even know why I have to die.

199
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:46,315
But, my life is so bad.

200
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,482
If I could live again, I... I...

201
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:55,823
Rias-senpai... Her beautiful red hair...

202
00:12:55,847 --> 00:13:01,656
If I die, I want to die on the chest of a beautiful girl like her.

203
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:19,458
You called me, right?

204
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:22,672
Who-Who?

205
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,847
If you die, I will take you.

206
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:31,347
Wings again.

207
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:34,021
You will...

208
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:37,767
...give up your life for me.

209
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:51,077
Wake up or I'll kill you.

210
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:53,656
Wake up. If you don't, I'll kill you.

211
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,831
Wa-

212
00:13:55,457 --> 00:13:56,831
It's very heavy.

213
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,656
This thing gives me weird dreams.

214
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,212
Dream?

215
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:07,712
You really don't remember Yuuma-chan?

216
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:10,220
I told you I don't know her.

217
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:15,180
You never introduced a girl like that to us, and there's no way you have a girlfriend!

218
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:16,640
There's no way you're bald!

219
00:14:16,664 --> 00:14:18,228
I have the email address-

220
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:19,609
There isn't any!

221
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:23,220
Yuuma-chan's phone number and email...

222
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:25,521
...is lost.

223
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:32,982
Rias-senpai!

224
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:33,902
Correct?

225
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:36,450
Rias-senpai!

226
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,529
She is beautiful as usual.

227
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:54,299
She is so beautiful!

228
00:14:54,323 --> 00:14:58,926
Yes, it's the scent, that makes it so amazing!

229
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:03,339
You must be going a little crazy because of your perverted fantasies.

230
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:05,474
I'm not like you guys! I'm sure-

231
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,767
That's enough. Today we gather at my house.

232
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,307
We will enjoy my special collection together!

233
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:11,220
DVD Por-

234
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,807
They are disgusting.

235
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:14,561
All they think about is perverted things.

236
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:15,521
Disgusting.

237
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:16,307
Pervert.

238
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:20,561
I mean, I have some of the latest "adult tape" releases.

239
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,855
Oh, that's amazing!

240
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,402
Issei, it's time you replaced your fantasies with real erotica.

241
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:26,783
Changed!

242
00:15:29,488 --> 00:15:32,870
This is Momo-chan's new work, Kaben Rider Pinky!

243
00:15:32,894 --> 00:15:34,910
Quite difficult to get.

244
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,497
It turns out that there really is something strange.

245
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:42,172
Is it possible that the precious memories of the past few days were just a dream?

246
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:45,799
If that's true, what happened to my original memories from those days?

247
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:46,926
Hey!

248
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,950
What's wrong, Issei?

249
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:51,178
You're a fan of Momozono Momo, right?

250
00:15:51,202 --> 00:15:51,678
Yes.

251
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:55,932
Oh yeah, let's turn off the lights to make it even more exciting.
(<i>Deadly Lick!</i>)

252
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,303
(<i>Deadly Lick!</i>)

253
00:15:57,327 --> 00:15:58,263
So exciting!

254
00:15:58,287 --> 00:15:59,684
Is not it?

255
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,977
Raider's riding moves are amazing!

256
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,168
Hey, it's not dead.

257
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:04,690
Huh? What did you say?

258
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,190
The lights don't go out.

259
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:08,229
What?

260
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:09,698
What are you talking about?

261
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:11,063
Not that.

262
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:13,362
<i>The lights are off</i>

263
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,275
I don't feel the light.

264
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:16,989
But can see it.

265
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:18,029
I saw it.

266
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:21,908
Excuse me.

267
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:23,701
I'm going home first.

268
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:26,376
Hey, are you not feeling well?

269
00:16:34,185 --> 00:16:37,376
I can see it clearer than during the day.

270
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:43,096
And, for some reason, I felt a power flowing through my body.

271
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,890
No, buy me one!

272
00:16:44,914 --> 00:16:47,596
If you keep whining, I'll leave!

273
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,887
No!

274
00:16:49,902 --> 00:16:53,308
Why can I hear voices so far away?!

275
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:55,935
What happened to me?

276
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,814
My body is feeling weird.

277
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:01,949
This park...

278
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,447
Oh yeah, right here.

279
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,945
Here I am on a date with Yuuma-chan.

280
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:12,532
Yuuma-chan...

281
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:17,826
I don't want to believe it.

282
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:21,792
What?

283
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:27,631
What a shame.

284
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:32,970
Why is this? I can't stop shaking.
(<i>Maybe this is my lucky day to meet you in this place.</i>)

285
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,690
I just meant to step back a bit!

286
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,522
Want to run away, huh?

287
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:51,061
I don't know what's happening!

288
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:53,948
Hair?

289
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:55,647
Yuuma-chan?

290
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:04,954
This was why low level creatures were so troublesome.

291
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:07,581
A-Am I dreaming again?

292
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,389
I can't feel the presence of my master or my friends.

293
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:17,545
You didn't try to escape or create a magic circle.

294
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:21,347
Analyzing the situation, you must be lost.

295
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:25,591
Then I can kill.

296
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:27,011
If this is the same dream,

297
00:18:27,035 --> 00:18:30,811
I'd rather have a pretty girl do it than a guy like him!

298
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:35,737
Sick.

299
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:38,737
It really hurts.

300
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:41,863
It doesn't hurt this much when Yuuma-chan does it...

301
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:45,613
It hurts, right?

302
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:49,494
That light is a painful poison for a race like yours.

303
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:52,825
I thought it would kill you instantly, but you're quite tough.

304
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:57,412
Don't worry. I'll finish you off soon.

305
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,785
It's useless now.

306
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,672
Someone... help me!

307
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:04,958
Did you do that?

308
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:07,466
I don't think so.

309
00:19:08,853 --> 00:19:11,210
Don't touch the child.

310
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:13,471
Red hair...

311
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:16,715
Ri-Rias-senpai...

312
00:19:17,469 --> 00:19:20,430
Who are you?

313
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:28,203
Damn you!

314
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:37,781
Red hair... I see.

315
00:19:37,805 --> 00:19:39,241
You must be from the Gremory family.

316
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:44,747
I'm Rias Gremory. How are you, Outcast Angel?

317
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:47,334
Oh, wow.

318
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:51,515
Who would have thought that this area was under the control of the Gremory family?

319
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,880
Is he a member of your family?

320
00:19:53,904 --> 00:19:57,165
I won't forgive you if you hurt him.

321
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:59,774
Well, I apologize for today,

322
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,052
but you better not let your slaves wander around on their own.

323
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:07,399
Someone like me would probably kill him while he was out walking, you know?

324
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:09,852
Thank you for the advice.

325
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,437
So let me remind you too...

326
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:16,635
...I won't let you do something like this again.

327
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,903
You too, heir to the Gremory family.

328
00:20:23,902 --> 00:20:26,237
My name is Donnasiege.

329
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:29,233
I hope we never meet again.

330
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:38,287
I was reckless. Who would have thought he would meet the Forsaken Angel.

331
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,406
If this continues he could die.

332
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,247
I won't let him die.

333
00:20:43,168 --> 00:20:46,683
Because, he is mine...

334
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,919
Wake up, sir!

335
00:20:52,436 --> 00:20:53,927
Sir-

336
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:58,053
It's very heavy.

337
00:20:58,076 --> 00:21:00,217
I had a strange dream again.

338
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,558
Why does this happen at night after-

339
00:21:02,892 --> 00:21:05,225
Huh? Why am I naked?

340
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:06,556
Where are my panties?

341
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,983
Rias-senpai!?

342
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:22,165
Is it morning already?

343
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,584
B-Boobs!

344
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,074
Good morning.

345
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,327
A-Anu, Rias-senpai, w-why are you...?

346
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:34,707
Wait, this is just a dream?

347
00:21:34,723 --> 00:21:36,247
Yes, I'm still dreaming!

348
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:41,834
Everything you experience is real.

349
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:45,006
I'm Rias Gremory...

350
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:46,212
I am a devil...

351
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:48,259
T-The Devil?

352
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:51,886
And also your master.

353
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:55,431
Nice to have you, Kyoudou Issei-kun.

354
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:31,470
Imagine something very powerful.

355
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:34,348
I will be the Harem King!

356
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,642
Give me strength!

357
00:23:36,658 --> 00:23:40,802
Well, I got a stupid little brother.
